            <p> This collective is more than clothing. </p>

            <p> Guts and Glory is a call. </p>

            <p> We are taking our innermost and using it for His utmost. </p>

            <p> As children, nothing seemed impossible. There was a sense of recklessness in every action, with no attachment to the outcome and no consideration for the potential consequences. </p>

            <p> I know for me, I could make friends with anyone on the playground. I could bomb a hill on a skateboard with zero concern for broken bones. Embarrassment in front of crowds didn't exist. I wasn't scared to try something new and possibly fail. </p>

            <p> See, there was a time when we were limitless.</p>

            <p> But at some point in life, we realized that we were fragile. We became aware of possible limitations. We started caring about the opinions of others. We placed parameters on what it looks like to be human. We began to proceed with caution. </p>

            <p> What would life look like if we went back to that childlike freedom? </p>

            <p> What would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail? </p>
            
            <p> I'd say that requires some guts. </p>

            <p> There is no reward without risk.</p>

            <p> Now take those radical behaviors and risk it all for the one that gave everything up for you. </p>

            <p> Let's use our guts for His glory. </p>

            <p> What if it all began with wearing a piece of clothing? </p>

                Every article of clothing produced is repurposed and has its own unique story, feel, and design. Similar to your fingerprints, freckles, or genetic makeup - no two pieces are the same. Each item is as original as yourself. You are one-of-a-kind and we believe there should be a piece of clothing to reflect that individuality. 
            </p>

            <p> With that being said, you have a specific call on your life that no one else can fulfill. </p>
            
            <p> We weren't called to a life of comfort...</p>
            
            <p> We were created to challenge contentment, convenience, and complacency.</p>
            
            <p> What opportunities could arise if you took a step out of your comfort zone?</p>
            
            <p> Right on the other side of obedience is blessings. </p>
            
            <p> What are you being called to today? </p>
